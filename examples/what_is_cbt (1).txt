		  text: Did you know that nearly 1.5 million people in England experience both problem debt and mental health issues? Funny to think that there is a link between money problems and mental health, huh? Well, finances and mental health can be a vicious cycle that can feel really hard to escape.

		  text: it’s pretty clear what’s happening here (and probably something most people can relate to). It’s not clear where it starts, whether money worries cause mental health challenges or the other way round, but the two are definitely connected, and they can certainly make each other worse if left un-checked.
		- item: para_3
		  text: The good news is you can take control of this cycle by using strategies that will help you to (1) Manage your feelings, (2) Control your thoughts and (3) Take control of your financial decisions.

		- item: q1
		  question: Worrying about money causes mental health problems
		  options: [True, False]
		  answer: False
		  text: False: remember, it is not always clear what causes mental health challenges. Some studies show that mental health difficulties might actually be the cause of financial challenges. It seems to work both ways, and one problem can make the other worse.
